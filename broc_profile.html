                    I am Broc Edson. I program for video games. I am currently a student at Bradley
                    University, but I will be graduating in 2022. I have had a lifelong passion for
                    video games and the process of making them. Over the years I have been involved
                    in many game projects, including Lingering Legacy, Disaster Golf, and many game
                    jams and personal projects.
