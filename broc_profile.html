                <p>
                    I am Broc Edson. I program for video games. I am currently a student at Bradley
                    University, but I will be graduating in 2022. I have had a lifelong passion for
                    video games and the process of making them. Over the years I have been involved
                    in many game projects, including Lingering Legacy, Disaster Golf, and many game
                    jams and personal projects.
                    <br><br>The hobbies that I enjoy include playing video games and D&D, drawing, 
                    listening to music, doing improv, and reading books.
